# 12/8 - Post Election Narrative

# Overview

Now that the 2020 election is over, there is speculation as to why certain candidates performed the way they did. 2020 was a very unique year for the United States where there were numerous events like a global pandemic and social unrest that all had played a signficant role on the country. Moreover, I will be dedicating this blog post to a post election narrative, which is a narrative by the media that is based on speculation rather than analysis. 

The narrative I will work on  will focus on the immediate speculation that the death of George Floyd cost Donald Trump black support in the election and may have played a signficant role in his loss to Biden. 

The death of George Floyd and its impact on Trump's black support has been an ongoing narrative in the media as many outlets and political scientists believe that Trump's response to the public outcry and social unrest that resulted from the death seemed apathetic and thus negatively impacted his black support. Many [news outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-donald-trump-black-lives-matter) deemed Trump as "clueless" in regards to the disadvantages faced by African Americans and his refusal to denounce white supremacy clearly after the death may negatively impact him during the election. 

Moreover, this narrative is important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester in Gov 1347. One such election-related variable we learned was shocks. Just like how we studied the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the election outcome where the effects of the pandemic are considered a shock, we can also consider the rise of racial tension after the death of George Floyd as a shock that can impact Trump's support. The racial tension is even more evident when you consider how Trump reacted to protests for black rights with militias and apatheic diction in his speeches afterwards.  

# Testable Implication

For this narrative, I will be using a testable implication. A testable implication is not necessarily a definitive test of the truth that involves difficulty questions of casualty and unavailable data, but an implication that involves initial evidence that the data is consistent or inconsistent with claims. Therefore, testable implication for this narrative is:

**If Trump's response to the death of Geroge Floyd lost black votes, then we should see a decrease in black support for Trump post-death of George Floyd.**

This testable implication is justifiable for this narrative because a decrease in black support for Trump does not definitely prove the claim that Trump's response to the death of George Floyd lost black votes; however, a decrease in black support could be a piece of evidence. Moreover, this testable implication can be tested in an effective manner as there is data on Trump's approval ratings and support after the death of George Floyd, which can be collected for the testable implication.
