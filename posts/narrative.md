# 12/8 - Post Election Narrative

# Overview

Now that the 2020 election is over, there is speculation as to why certain candidates performed the way they did. 2020 was a very unique year for the United States where there were numerous events like a global pandemic and social unrest that all had played a signficant role on the country. Moreover, I will be dedicating this blog post to a post election narrative, which is a narrative by the media that is based on speculation rather than analysis. 

+ The narrative I will work on  will focus on the immediate speculation that the death of George Floyd cost Donald Trump black support in the election and may have played a signficant role in his loss to Biden. 
+ The death of George Floyd and its impact on Trump's black support has been an ongoing [narrative](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/politics/trump-george-floyd-maine/index.html) in the media as many outlets and political scientists believe that Trump's response to the public outcry and social unrest that resulted from the death seemed apathetic and disconnected and thus negatively impacted his black support. 
+ Many [news outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-donald-trump-black-lives-matter) deemed Trump as "clueless" in regards to the disadvantages faced by African Americans and his refusal to denounce white supremacy clearly after the death may negatively impact him during the election. 
+ Moreover, this narrative is important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester in Gov 1347. One such election-related variable we learned was shocks. 
++ Just like how we studied the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the election outcome where the effects of the pandemic are considered a shock, we can also consider the rise of racial tension after the death of George Floyd as a shock that can impact Trump's support. The racial tension is even more evident when you consider how Trump reacted to protests for black rights with militias and apatheic diction in his speeches afterwards.  

# Testable Implication

For this narrative, I will be using a testable implication. A testable implication is not necessarily a definitive test of the truth that involves difficulty questions of casualty and unavailable data, but an implication that involves initial evidence that the data is consistent or inconsistent with claims. Therefore, testable implication for this narrative is:

**If Trump's response to the death of Geroge Floyd lost black votes, then we should see a decrease in black support for Trump post-death of George Floyd.**

This testable implication is justifiable for this narrative because a decrease in black support for Trump does not definitely prove the claim that Trump's response to the death of George Floyd lost black votes; however, a decrease in black support could be a piece of evidence that Trump's response to the death of George Floyd lost black votes. Moreover, this testable implication can be tested as there is data on Trump's approval ratings and support after the death of George Floyd, which can be collected and used for the testable implication.

# Data Collected

The data I used for the testable implication was sourced from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape where they have data on public opinions in the leadup to the 2020 election. Thus, the data I will be looking at is Trump's approval rating among African Americans before and after the death of George Floyd. Looking at this data can help us understand if Trump's support among black people fell after the death of George Floyd as approval ratings are a good indicator of public support. In addition, this data will show patterns and trends to better analyze the testable implication. 


# Results

Figure 1. Trump's approval ratings among African Americans

According to Figure 1, we can see Trump's approval rating leading up to the death of George Floyd and after the death of Geroge Floyd. We can see that his approval rating among African Americans dropped somewhat sharply by 5 percentage points after the death. Furthermore, we can also see that his approval rating among black people did not reach the same peak it did on 5/21 - 5/27, which was 21%, given the available data. Therefore, the results of this test does support the narrative to a degree. This is because we can see that his approval ratings decreased among black people, which may have contributed to the outcome of the election. However, Trump's approval ratings started to increase on 6/18 where his approval rating reached 18% on 6/25 - 7/1. This might mean that Trump's response to the death of George Floyd may not have had a very significant impact on black support since his approval rating among African Americans was steadily increasing about a month after the death. This could also mean that Trump's loss in black support after the death may have been temporary, evidenced by the sharp decline right after the death but a steady increase about a month after the death.
