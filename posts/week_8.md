# 11/1 - Predicting the 2020 Election

## Overview

The time has come! It is time to make our final prediction for the 2020 Presidential election. The upcoming election will be a very unique one. America has not witnessed events like the Coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest from the death of George Floyd in a long time, which may impact voting behaviors. Furthermore, the pandemic has played detrimental effects on the economy, also possibly impacting voting behaviors. In this blog, I will talk about the model we will use to forecast the 2020 election. 

# Poll Model

The first model I created was a poll model, which is a linear model. The formula of the model uses average poll support as a predictor with a response variable that is Republican vote share and the model uses historical state level polling data from 1972 to 2016. Moreover, the linear model was used to predict Trump's vote share in each state for 2020 using poll averages from 10/31/20. 

Historical Republican two-party popular vote share versus state polling averages one week out or less from the election. (1972-2016) Poll averages from 10/29/20 were used to make a prediction for 2020.
